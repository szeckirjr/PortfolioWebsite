      <h3>CSC111 and CSC115 - Fundamentals of Programming with Engineering Applications I & II</h3>
      <p>CSC111 taught me C language for the first time.<br>
          CSC115 taught me Java language for the first time, and also a multitude of different data structures and algorithms.<br>
          Received a congratulatory letter on both courses for being on the top 10% of the class with a grade of A+ (95%) for both.<br><br>

      <h3 style="transform:translateY(-5%);">ENGR110 and ENGR120 - Design and Communication I & II</h3>
      <p style="transform:translateY(-5%);">Both courses are divided into a design and a communication section.<br>
        For ENGR110, the communication section taught us how to do research and write a paper on a topic involving transportation methods. I wrote my research paper on the concept of the Hyperloop by Elon Musk and ended up getting 100% on it! You can read my essay <a href="https://google.com">here</a>. The design section required us to make up a new viable method of improving transit in area. Our team presented Rentals of Electric Scooters and we got chosen to participate in a final presentation as one of the top 20 groups. Overall, our group ended up getting 4th place.<br>
        For ENGR120, the communication section was focused on technical documents (e.g. reports, manuals, memos, abstracts, etc). However, the design section was all about designing, building, and coding a robot using a VEX Robotics Kit. Out of my team, I was picked as the programmer and had to write code in RobotC to move the robot towards a beacon of infrared light, connect a cable to it, and back away for not getting untangled. After hours of programming and several days waking up at 5am for testing, our robot ended up performing very well and got chosen for the final competition as one of the best robots in the class.<br>
        Got a final grade of A for both of those courses.<br><br>

      <h3>SENG265 - Software Development Methods</h3>
      <p>SENG265 taught me a variety of different things. From terminal commands and git to C and Python languages, this course covered a lot. The most frustrating but also coolest assignments were given, which you can checkout at my Projects section!<br><br>

      <h3>MATH109 & 101 (Calculus I & II), MATH110 (Matrix Algebra for Engineers) & MATH122 (Logic and Foundations)</h3>
      <p>MATH109 & 101 taught me the foundations for calculus, which opened up a world of possibilities to understanding other topics. Ended up with an A+ on both courses.<br>
        MATH110 taught me linear algebra with matrices, which has been extremely useful for all my other courses so far at UVic. For this course, I also ended up with an A+.<br>
        MATH122 was a very interesting course on logic. From set theory and induction to recursive definitions and functions, this course was very useful to understand the basis of math itself. This has been my highest grade at UVic so far, with a 99%.<br><br>

      <h3>THEA150 - Public Speaking</h3>
      <p>THEA150 was a class I had been meaning to take for so long, which was a class on public speaking, which taught us how to write and deliver speeches (using verbal and non-verbal skills)! Three speeches were given (i.e. informative, persuasive, and lastly one with a visual aids).<br><br>

      <h3>ECE255 (Introduction to Computer Architecture), ECE260 (Continuous-Time Signals and Systems) & ECE310 (Digital Signal Processing I)</h3>
      <p>ECE255 taught me the foundations of computer architecture. It was extremely interesting to learn how computers work at its core. Labs for this courses also included learning assembly language, which was very different than all the other high-level languages I was used to. I ended up getting an A+ on this course.<br>
        Both ECE260 and ECE310 taught me about signal/systems. From properties and convolution to Fourier Transforms and MatLab. Very challenging but interesting courses.<br><br>

      <h3 style="transform:translateY(-6%);">Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects</h3>
      <p style="transform:translateY(-6%);">This was a course I was meaning to take for so long, and it was not until the Summer of 2019 that I was able to do so. It taught me a lot about how our brains work, how to more productive, and learn better (i.e. faster and more in depth). Very interesting course that I recommend to everyone I know.<br>
        This course is offered for free by a couple universities, which is just incredible! Since I am on a student budget, I did not purchase the Certificate for completion, since the topics in the course was what interested me in the first place.<br><br>

      <h3>HTML and CSS for Beginners</h3>
      <p>Another course I have been wanting to take for a while. It teaches the basics of HTML/CSS to get you started. It was this course that allowed me to build this website from scratch (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).<br><br>
